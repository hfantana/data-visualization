    "* **Country**: Name of the country\n",
    "* **Region**: Region the country belongs to\n",
    "* **Happiness_Score**: Participants were asked: “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also consider some factors that potentially contribute to Happiness_Score:\n",
    "* **Economy**: GDP per capita\n",
    "* **Health**: Average life expectancy\n",
    "* **Family**: Measured via the binary question: “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”\n",
    "* **Freedom**: Measured via the binary question: “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”\n",
    "* **Trust**: Measured via the binary questions: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” \n",
    "* **Generosity**: The residual of regressing responses to the binary question: “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: These variables are taken from a number of diffrent measurements and some have been altered and standardized so that the data set can be analyzed. There are various ways in which the data sets can be interpreted and analyzed and this tutorial uses simplified data sets and analyses for the purposes of demonstrating data visulizations.
